abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

Clinicians may find difficulties in the selection of appropriate interventions for AIS. A comprehensive literature review was carried out to study all contemporary non-operative interventions, it was noted that rigid spinal orthoses apparently give more curve control; however, it would compromise the patient's quality of life via those inevitable factors--physical constraint, poor acceptance and psychological disturbance. There is a trend to develop more effective, acceptable and user-friendly interventions. Under such an aspiration, the theories and clinical evidence of different interventions should be developed along the clinical pathway of early intervention with reliable indicators/predictors, patient's active participation, dynamic control mechanism, holistic psychological and psychosocial considerations, and effective and long-lasting outcome.},

abstract = {Cancer gene panels (CGPs) are already used in clinical practice to match tumor's genetic profile with available targeted therapies. We aimed to determine if CGPs could also be applied to estimate tumor mutational load and predict clinical benefit to PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade therapy. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) mutation data obtained from melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients published by Snyder et al. 2014 and Rizvi et al. 2015, respectively, were used to select nonsynonymous somatic mutations occurring in genes included in the Foundation Medicine Panel (FM-CGP) and in our own Institutional Panel (HSL-CGP). CGP-mutational load was calculated for each patient using both panels and was associated with clinical outcomes as defined and reported in the original articles. Higher CGP-mutational load was observed in NSCLC patients presenting durable clinical benefit (DCB) to PD-1 blockade (FM-CGP P=0.03, HSL-CGP P=0.01). We also observed that 69{\%} of patients with high CGP-mutational load experienced DCB to PD-1 blockade, as compared to 20{\%} of patients with low CGP-mutational load (FM-CGP and HSL-CGP P=0.01). Noteworthy, predictive accuracy of CGP-mutational load for DCB was not statistically different from that estimated by WES sequencing (P=0.73). Moreover, a high CGP-mutational load was significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with PD-1 blockade (FM-CGP P=0.005, HR 0.27, 95{\%} IC 0.105 to 0.669; HSL-CGP P=0.008, HR 0.29, 95{\%} IC 0.116 to 0.719). Similar associations between CGP-mutational load and clinical benefit to CTLA-4 blockade were not observed. In summary, our data reveals that CGPs can be used to estimate mutational load and to predict clinical benefit to PD-1 blockade, with similar accuracy to that reported using WES.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND While clinical outcomes following immunotherapy have shown an association with tumor mutation load using whole exome sequencing (WES), its clinical applicability is currently limited by cost and bioinformatics requirements. METHODS We developed a method to accurately derive the predicted total mutation load (PTML) within individual tumors from a small set of genes that can be used in clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) panels. PTML was derived from the actual total mutation load (ATML) of 575 distinct melanoma and lung cancer samples and validated using independent melanoma (n = 312) and lung cancer (n = 217) cohorts. The correlation of PTML status with clinical outcome, following distinct immunotherapies, was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS PTML (derived from 170 genes) was highly correlated with ATML in cutaneous melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma validation cohorts (R(2) = 0.73 and R(2) = 0.82, respectively). PTML was strongly associated with clinical outcome to ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4, three cohorts) and adoptive T-cell therapy (1 cohort) clinical outcome in melanoma. Clinical benefit from pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in lung cancer was also shown to significantly correlate with PTML status (log rank P value {\textless} 0.05 in all cohorts). CONCLUSIONS The approach of using small NGS gene panels, already applied to guide employment of targeted therapies, may have utility in the personalized use of immunotherapy in cancer.},

Multi-region sequencing allows the temporal order of some genomic changes in a tumor to be inferred, but the robust identification of repeated evolution across patients remains a challenge. We developed a machine-learning method based on transfer learning that allowed us to overcome the stochastic effects of cancer evolution and noise in data and identified hidden evolutionary patterns in cancer cohorts. When applied to multi-region sequencing datasets from lung, breast, renal, and colorectal cancer (768 samples from 178 patients), our method detected repeated evolutionary trajectories in subgroups of patients, which were reproduced in single-sample cohorts (n = 2,935). Our method provides a means of classifying patients on the basis of how their tumor evolved, with implications for the anticipation of disease progression.},

abstract = {Harnessing an antitumor immune response has been a fundamental strategy in cancer immunotherapy. For over a century, efforts have primarily focused on amplifying immune activation mechanisms that are employed by humans to eliminate invaders such as viruses and bacteria. This “immune enhancement” strategy often results in rare objective responses and frequent immune-related adverse events (irAEs). However, in the last decade, cancer immunotherapies targeting the B7-H1/PD-1 pathway (anti-PD therapy), have achieved higher objective response rates in patients with much fewer irAEs. This more beneficial tumor response-to-toxicity profile stems from distinct mechanisms of action that restore tumor-induced immune deficiency selectively in the tumor microenvironment, here termed “immune normalization,” which has led to its FDA approval in more than 10 cancer indications and facilitated its combination with different therapies. In this article, we wish to highlight the principles of immune normalization and learn from it, with the ultimate goal to guide better designs for future cancer immunotherapies. This Perspective discusses the concept of immune normalization and how its underlying principles may help to augment, as well as design, cancer immunotherapies.},

abstract = {Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) critically contribute to the efficacy of anti-tumor therapeutic antibodies. We report here an unexpected finding that macrophages after ADCP inhibit NK cell-mediated ADCC and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in breast cancers and lymphomas. Mechanistically, AIM2 is recruited to the phagosomes by Fc$\gamma$R signaling following ADCP and activated by sensing the phagocytosed tumor DNAs through the disrupted phagosomal membrane, which subsequently upregulates PD-L1 and IDO and causes immunosuppression. Combined treatment with anti-HER2 antibody and inhibitors of PD-L1 and IDO enhances anti-tumor immunity and anti-HER2 therapeutic efficacy in mouse models. Furthermore, neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy significantly upregulates PD-L1 and IDO in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of HER2+breast cancer patients, correlating with poor trastuzumab response. Collectively, our findings unveil a deleterious role of ADCP macrophages in cancer immunosuppression and suggest that therapeutic antibody plus immune checkpoint blockade may provide synergistic effects in cancer treatment. Therapeutic antibody-based cancer treatment leads to ADCP-induced, AIM2-mediated immunosuppression by macrophages that can be overcome with concomitant immune checkpoint blockade.},

abstract = {Precision or personalized cancer medicine is a clinical approach that strives to customize therapies based upon the genomic profiles of individual patient tumors. Machine learning (ML) is a computational method particularly suited to the establishment of predictive models of drug response based on genomic profiles of targeted cells. We report here on the application of our previously established open-source support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm to predict the responses of 175 individual cancer patients to a variety of standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs from the gene-expression profiles (RNA-seq or microarray) of individual patient tumors. The models were found to predict patient responses with {\textgreater}80{\%} accuracy. The high PPV of our algorithms across multiple drugs suggests a potential clinical utility of our approach, particularly with respect to the identification of promising second-line treatments for patients failing standard-of-care first-line therapies. A primary goal of precision cancer medicine is the accurate prediction of optimal drug therapies based upon the personalized molecular profiles of patient tumors 1. Ideally, such predictions are based upon well-established molecular cause-and-effect relationships that are disrupted in cancer cells. A notable example is the targeted inhibition of the Abl tyrosine kinase gene in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) 2. Unfortunately, the molecular processes underlying most cancers, and especially solid tumors, are currently not as well understood as for CML 3. An alternative path to accurate predictions is based simply on observed, significant correlations , even when the underlying causal connections are unknown or incompletely understood. The foundation of accurate correlative predictions is built upon extensive and reliable bodies of data, and the volume of cancer-relevant data being generated and computationally stored on a daily basis vastly exceeds what could be even imagined only a few decades ago. For example, the volume of cancer-relevant molecular data being generated by genomic studies alone (DNA sequencing, RNA expression, etc.) is currently doubling about every 6-7 months and, within the next decade, is estimated to constitute up to 40 million gigabytes a year 4. The search for significant correlations in cancer-relevant datasets is a task ideally suited to computers and specifically to a branch of artificial intelligence called machine learning (ML). Toward that end, a number of ML-based approaches have been developed in recent years that input the genomic profiles of individual patient tumors and output predictions of optimal drug responses based upon correlations embedded within previously established datasets 5. We recently introduced an "open source" support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm that inputs gene expression profiles of cancer cells to predict the response of individual cancers to chemother-apeutic drugs 6. In addition to accurately predicting the response of a variety of cancer cell lines to 7 commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic drugs, we employed the algorithm to predict the sensitivities of 273 ovarian cancer patients to these same drugs 6. These predictions were shown to correlate significantly with previously reported average response rates of independent groups of ovarian cancer patients to these drugs (Linear regression p value = 0.0031, R 2 = 0.8201) lending further credibility to our approach 6 .},

abstract = {Sequential profiling of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) holds immense promise for early detection of patient progression. However, how to exploit the predictive power of cfDNA as a liquid biopsy in the clinic remains unclear. RAS pathway aberrations can be tracked in cfDNA to monitor resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In this prospective phase II clinical trial of single-agent cetuximab in RAS wild-type patients, we combine genomic profiling of serial cfDNA and matched sequential tissue biopsies with imaging and mathematical modeling of cancer evolution. We show that a significant proportion of patients defined as RAS wild-type based on diagnostic tissue analysis harbor aberrations in the RAS pathway in pretreatment cfDNA and, in fact, do not benefit from EGFR inhibition. We demonstrate that primary and acquired resistance to cetuximab are often of polyclonal nature, and these dynamics can be observed in tissue and plasma. Furthermore, evolutionary modeling combined with frequent serial sampling of cfDNA allows prediction of the expected time to treatment failure in individual patients. This study demonstrates how integrating frequently sampled longitudinal liquid biopsies with a mathematical framework of tumor evolution allows individualized quantitative forecasting of progression, providing novel opportunities for adaptive personalized therapies.SIGNIFICANCE: Liquid biopsies capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity underpinning resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in colorectal cancer. Dense serial sampling is needed to predict the time to treatment failure and generate a window of opportunity for intervention. Cancer Discov; 8(10); 1-16. {\textcopyright}2018 AACR.},

The aim of the study was to optimise this panel for the detection of MSI.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We developed an assay allowing co-amplification of six mononucleotide repeat markers (BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, NR21, NR22, NR27) and one polymorphic dinucleotide marker (D3S1260) in a single reaction. Performances of the new panel were evaluated on a cohort of patients suspected of LS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrate that our assay is technically as easy to use as the pentaplex assay. The hexaplex panel shows similar performances for the identification of colorectal and non-MSH6-deficient tumours. On the other hand, the hexaplex panel has higher sensitivity for the identification of MSH6-deficient tumours (94.7{\%} vs 84.2{\%}) and MMR-deficient tumours other than colorectal cancer (92.9{\%} vs 85.7{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The hexaplex panel could thus be an attractive alternative to the pentaplex panel for the identification of patients with LS.},

abstract = {Cancer research is living a time of unparalleled expectations around immunotherapy, a therapeutic strategy that materializes the elegant idea of weaponizing our immune system to eradicate tumor cells. In an everchanging standard of care, a growing number of studies have shown that immunotherapy may accelerate tumor progression in a significant subset of patients ranging from 4{\%} to 29{\%} across multiple histologies. The identification of hyperprogression poses a challenge for RECIST criteria, which fail to capture pre- and post-treatment tumor growth kinetics at early times of disease. To this end, parameters such as the TGR (Tumor Growth Rate), TGK (Tumor Growth Kinetics), and TTF (Time to Treatment Failure) have been proposed. Although the definition of hyperprogression is not consistent among research groups, it may be depicted as a RECIST progression at the first on-treatment scan with at least a doubling in growth pace when comparing pre- and post-treatment periods. Unlike pseudoprogression, patients displaying hyperprogression present worse survival outcomes. This phenomenon has been independently associated to older age, higher metastatic load, and previous irradiation, but remarkably failed to show association to tumor burden or aggressive pre-treatment growth. Despite the pivotal interest of recognizing subjects at increased risk of hyperprogression, only MDM2 amplification and EGFR aberrations have been described as potential biomarkers and require further validation. In addition, tumor mutation burden and circulating DNA may be valuable to this purpose. This work provides an update on epidemiology, clinical predictors, biomarkers, and a plausible molecular rationale of hyperprogressive disease after immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Purpose Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a pattern of hypermutation that occurs at genomic microsatellites and is caused by defects in the mismatch repair system. Mismatch repair deficiency that leads to MSI has been well described in several types of human cancer, most frequently in colorectal, endometrial, and gastric adenocarcinomas. MSI is known to be both predictive and prognostic, especially in colorectal cancer; however, current clinical guidelines only recommend MSI testing for colorectal and endometrial cancers. Therefore, less is known about the prevalence and extent of MSI among other types of cancer. Methods Using our recently published MSI-calling software, MANTIS, we analyzed whole-exome data from 11,139 tumor-normal pairs from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments projects and external data sources across 39 cancer types. Within a subset of these cancer types, we assessed mutation burden, mutational signatures, and somatic variants associated with MSI. Results We identified MSI in 3.8{\%} of all cancers assessed-present in 27 of tumor types-most notably adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), cervical cancer (CESC), and mesothelioma, in which MSI has not yet been well described. In addition, MSI-high ACC and CESC tumors were observed to have a higher average mutational burden than microsatellite-stable ACC and CESC tumors. Conclusion We provide evidence of as-yet-unappreciated MSI in several types of cancer. These findings support an expanded role for clinical MSI testing across multiple cancer types as patients with MSI-positive tumors are predicted to benefit from novel immunotherapies in clinical trials.},

abstract = {Initial results by Le and colleagues, which were published in the June 25, 2015 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, report significant responses of cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI) to anti-PD-1 inhibitors in patients who failed conventional therapy. This finding fits into a broader body of research associating somatic hypermutation and neoepitope formation with response to immunotherapy, with the added benefit of relying on a simple, widely used diagnostic test. This review surveys the pathogenesis and prognostic value of MSI, diagnostic guidelines for detecting it, and the frequency of MSI across tumors, with the goal of providing a reference for its use as a biomarker for PD-1 blockade. MSI usually arises from either germline mutations in components of the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2) in patients with Lynch syndrome or somatic hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. The result is a cancer with a 10- to 100-fold increase in mutations, associated in the colon with poor differentiation, an intense lymphocytic infiltrate, and a superior prognosis. Diagnostic approaches have evolved since the early 1990s, from relying exclusively on clinical criteria to incorporating pathologic features, PCR-based MSI testing, and immunohistochemistry for loss of MMR component expression. Tumor types can be grouped into categories based on the frequency of MSI, from colorectal (20{\%}) and endometrial (22{\%}-33{\%}) to cervical (8{\%}) and esophageal (7{\%}) to skin and breast cancers (0{\%}-2{\%}). If initial results are validated, MSI testing could have an expanded role as a tool in the armamentarium of precision medicine. Clin Cancer Res; 22(4); 813-20. {\textcopyright}2016 AACR.},

Such high rates mean that spontaneous mutations that form new-length variants can realistically be seen in pedigree analysis. Data on observed mutation events from various organisms are now accumulating, allowing inferences on DNA sequence evolution to be made through an unusually direct approach. Here I discuss and integrate microsatellite mutation data in an evolutionary context. A striking feature of the mutation process is that it seems highly heterogeneous, with distinct differences between species, repeat types, loci and alleles. Age and sex also affect the mutation rate. Within genomes at equilibrium, the microsatellite-length distribution is a delicate balance between biased mutation processes and point mutations acting towards the decay of repetitive DNA. Indeed, simple repeats do not evolve simply.},

abstract = {Purpose: Tumor mutational burden (TMB) calculated by whole-exome sequencing (WES) is proved to be effective to predict the clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockades. However, WES is not commonly used in China. We aimed to determine if a 381-caner-gene panel (CGP) could be used to estimate TMB, delineate the landscape of TMB of Chinese patients and identify mutated genes and pathways related to higher TMB. Methods: We first evaluated the correlation between the TMB estimated by a 381-cancer-gene panel MasterView and WES using the data from the melanoma sample cohort. 3023 formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 2932 Chinese patients with advanced solid tumor were profiled for 381 gene sequencing, the baits of which covered 4,557 exons of 365 cancer-related genes and 47 introns of 25 genes frequently rearranged in cancer (All performed in a lab who achieved full marks five times in the external quality assessment by College of American Pathologists [CAP]). Using the sequencing data, we estimated the TMB of Chinese advanced solid tumor and identified mutated genes and pathways related to higher TMB level. Results: 381-CGP-mutational burden was strongly associated with those calculated by WES (R2 = 0.978). The median TMB for each tumor type was 5.65 (colorectal cancer), 4.84 (lung cancer), 4.03 (hepatobiliary cancer), 4.03 (gastric carcinoma), 4.03 (breast cancer) mutations/mb respectively. No correlation was observed between TMB level and age (P = 0.577) or gender (P = 0.307). The TMB of patients with mismatch repair (MMR) or DNA repair response (DDR) pathway deficiency was significantly higher than that without MMR or DDR pathway deficiency (P {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion: The 381-cancer gene panel is a clinical practicable method to assess tumor mutational burden compared with whole exome sequencing. MMR and DDR deficiency are correlated with higher tumor mutational burden of Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors.},

abstract = {Microsatellite instability (MSI) characterizes colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome and a proportion of sporadic CRCs. These MSI+CRCs share several clinicopathological features, including a reputation for better survival rates than MSI-cases and a pronounced stromal inflammatory reaction of still undefined nature. In the present study, the presence, spatial distribution, and activation status of infiltrating cytotoxic effectors were investigated comparatively in 18 MSI+and 37 MSI-CRCs by immunohistochemistry. The frequency of apoptosis was also evaluated by morphology and in situ end-labeling. MSI+cases carried significantly higher numbers of cytotoxic lymphocytes infiltrating within neoplastic epithelial structures, as shown by immunostaining for CD3 (15.1 ± 6.2 versus 4.6 ± 4.1, P {\textless} 0.001), CD8 (13 ± 6.4 versus 3.7 ± 3.8, P {\textless} 0.001), and TIA-1 (11.2 ± 6.5 versus 1.9 ± 1.7, P {\textless} 0.001). These cytotoxic effectors were globally more activated in MSI+than in MSI-tumors, as revealed by the expression of granzyme B (5.3 ± 4.5 versus 0.6 ± 1.3, P {\textless} 0.001). In MSI+CRCs, the number of intraepithelial activated cytotoxic lymphocytes was significantly correlated with the proximal location of the tumor, a poorly differentiated phenotype, and the presence of peritumor lymphoid nodules. Multivariate analysis revealed that MSI was the major determinant of the presence of activated cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes. Moreover, MSI+CRCs also showed a significantly higher percentage of tumor cells undergoing apoptotic cell death (4.1 ± 2.1 versus 2.6 ± 1.1, P {\textless} 0.0001, by the TUNEL method), often located in close proximity of activated cytotoxic lymphocytes. These results are consistent with the presence of anti-tumor cytotoxic immune responses in most of MSI+CRCs, a phenomenon that may at least in part contribute to the survival advantage ascribed to these patients.},

Identifying optimal biomarkers for response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies remains critical. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) may indicate genomic instability and potential neoantigen binding sites to activated effector T cells. Methods: We retrospectively examined tumor mutational burden (TMB) using next-generation sequencing (Foundation Medicine) for 83 patients with NSCLC in our institution. TMB included both coding and non-coding regions, but excluded potentially functional mutations. We correlated TMB (mutations per megabase) with smoking history, number of potentially functional mutations, variants of unknown significance, and the driver mutations EGFR, ALK, and KRAS. TMB high versus low was stratified based on 15 mutations per megabase pair. Results: Our findings demonstrated that TMB was significantly associated with current/former smoking status (p = 0.01, Table 1). TMB was also significantly associated with number of potentially functional mutations, number of variants of unknown significance (VUS), and total reported mutations (p {\textless} 0.01). The absence of mutations in EGFR, ALK, or KRAS tended to be associated with higher TMB as well (p = 0.07). Conclusions: TMB was associated with smoking status, as well as potentially functional mutations, VUS, and total number of reported mutations. Our results indicate that number of coding region mutations predict genomic instability in non-coding regions.

abstract = {The determination of the mutation load, a total number of nonsynonymous point mutations, by whole-exome sequencing was shown to be useful in predicting the treatment responses to cancer immunotherapy. However, this technique is expensive and time-consuming, which hampers its application in clinical practice. Therefore, the objective of this study was to construct a mutation load estimation model for lung adenocarcinoma, using a small set of genes, as a predictor of the immunotherapy treatment response. Using the somatic mutation data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, a computational framework was developed. The estimation model consisted of only 24 genes, used to estimate the mutation load in the independent validation cohort precisely (R2 = 0.7626). Additionally, the estimated mutation load can be used to identify the patients with durable clinical benefits, with 85{\%} sensitivity, 93{\%} specificity, and 89{\%} accuracy, indicating that the model can serve as a predictive biomarker for cancer immunotherapy treatment response. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrated the necessity of the cancer-specific models by the constructed melanoma and colorectal models. Since most genes in the lung adenocarcinoma model are not currently included in the sequencing panels, a customized targeted sequencing panel can be designed with the selected model genes to assess the mutation load, instead of whole-exome sequencing or the currently used panel-based methods. Consequently, the cost and time required for the assessment of mutation load may be considerably decreased, which indicates that the presented model is a more cost-effective approach to cancer immunotherapy response prediction in clinical practice.},

abstract = {157Background: Checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have been approved for frontline or subsequent therapies in several indications over the last few years. While patient response can be remarkably durable, many patients do not benefit. Current clinical biomarkers of response to CPIs include microsatellite instability (MSI) and PD-L1 expression. While a proportion of many solid tumors display microsatellite instability, the prevalence is often very low. Similarly, while clinically informative, PD-L1 expression alone is not sufficient to predict therapeutic outcomes with high accuracy. The lack of predictive biomarkers for response highlights the need for improved biomarkers with greater prevalence across tumor types to predict response to CPIs. Multiple clinical studies have revealed that high tumor mutational burden (TMB) is associated with improved clinical response. Methods: Here, we describe the development of a method that can be used to accurately infer mutational burden from a discrete set of targeted regions of interest across the exome. Initially, we performed an assessment of the accuracy across multiple bioinformatics methods for identification of individual sequence mutations (SBS/indels) using orthogonally validated data together with publicly available TCGA whole-exome sequencing data. The targeted regions were then isolated from these datasets to demonstrate analytical performance across several different solid tumor types. Finally, we evaluated independent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cohorts to demonstrate the analytical accuracy of the assay and bioinformatics approach for determination of mutational burden when compared to whole exome sequencing. Results: In summary, high concordance was observed across a large dynamic range of mutations per megabase of coding sequence. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the assay can be used to accurately determine mutational burden in a range of tumor types, across a spectra of potential mutational burden cut-offs using automated, complex mutation identification algorithms.},

abstract = {It is now well established that the immune system can recognize developing cancers and that therapeutic manipulation of immunity can induce tumor regression. The capacity to manifest remarkably durable responses in some patients has been ascribed in part to T cells that can (a) kill tumor cells directly, (b) orchestrate diverse antitumor immune responses, (c) manifest long-lasting memory, and (d) display remarkable specificity for tumor-derived proteins. This specificity stems from fundamental differences between cancer cells and their normal counterparts in that the former develop protein- altering mutations and undergo epigenetic and genetic alterations, resulting in aberrant protein expression. These events can result in formation of tumor antigens. The identification of mutated and aberrantly expressed self-tumor antigens has historically been time consuming and laborious. While mutant antigens are usually expressed in a tumor-specific manner, aberrantly expressed antigens are often shared between cancers and, therefore, in the past, have been the major focus of therapeutic cancer vaccines. However, advances in next-generation sequencing and epitope prediction now permit the rapid identification of mutant tumor neoantigens. This review focuses on a discussion of mutant tumor neoantigens and their use in personalizing cancer immunotherapies. Introduction},

abstract = {Tumor mutation load (TML) has been proposed as a biomarker of patient response to immunotherapy in several studies. TML is usually determined by tumor biopsy DNA (tDNA) whole exome sequencing (WES), therefore TML evaluation is limited by informative biopsy availability. Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) provided by liquid biopsy is a surrogate specimen to biopsy for molecular profiling. Nevertheless performing WES on DNA from plasma is technically challenging and the ability to determine tumor mutation load from liquid biopsies remains to be demonstrated. In the current study, WES was performed on cfDNA from 32 metastatic patients of various cancer types included into MOSCATO 01 (NCT01566019) and/or MATCHR (NCT02517892) molecular triage trials. Results from targeted gene sequencing (TGS) and WES performed on cfDNA were compared to results from tumor tissue biopsy. In cfDNA samples, WES mutation detection sensitivity was 92{\%} compared to targeted sequencing (TGS). When comparing cfDNA-WES to tDNA-WES, mutation detection sensitivity was 53{\%}, consistent with previously published prospective study comparing cfDNA-TGS to tDNA-TGS. For samples in which presence of tumor DNA was confirmed in cfDNA, tumor mutation load from liquid biopsy was correlated with tumor biopsy. Taken together, this study demonstrated that liquid biopsy may be applied to determine tumor mutation load. Qualification of liquid biopsy for interpretation is a crucial point to use cfDNA for mutational load estimation.},

abstract = {Preclinical models often fail to capture the diverse heterogeneity of human malignancies and as such lack clinical predictive power. Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) have emerged as a powerful technology: capable of retaining the molecular heterogeneity of their originating sample. However, heterogeneity within a tumor is governed by both cell-autonomous (e.g., genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity) and non-cell-autonomous (e.g., stromal heterogeneity) drivers. Although PDXs can largely recapitulate the polygenomic architecture of human tumors, they do not fully account for heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment. Hence, these models have substantial utility in basic and translational research in cancer biology; however, study of stromal or immune drivers of malignant progression may be limited. Similarly, PDX models offer the ability to conduct patient-specific in vivo and ex vivo drug screens, but stromal contributions to treatment responses may be under-represented. This review discusses the sources and consequences of intratumor heterogeneity and how these are recapitulated in the PDX model. Limitations of the current generation of PDXs are discussed and strategies to improve several aspects of the model with respect to preserving heterogeneity are proposed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND High tumor mutational burden (TMB) is an emerging biomarker of sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors and has been shown to be more significantly associated with response to PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy than PD-1 or PD-L1 expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The distribution of TMB and the subset of patients with high TMB has not been well characterized in the majority of cancer types. METHODS In this study, we compare TMB measured by a targeted comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assay to TMB measured by exome sequencing and simulate the expected variance in TMB when sequencing less than the whole exome. We then describe the distribution of TMB across a diverse cohort of 100,000 cancer cases and test for association between somatic alterations and TMB in over 100 tumor types. RESULTS We demonstrate that measurements of TMB from comprehensive genomic profiling are strongly reflective of measurements from whole exome sequencing and model that below 0.5 Mb the variance in measurement increases significantly. We find that a subset of patients exhibits high TMB across almost all types of cancer, including many rare tumor types, and characterize the relationship between high TMB and microsatellite instability status. We find that TMB increases significantly with age, showing a 2.4-fold difference between age 10 and age 90 years. Finally, we investigate the molecular basis of TMB and identify genes and mutations associated with TMB level. We identify a cluster of somatic mutations in the promoter of the gene PMS2, which occur in 10{\%} of skin cancers and are highly associated with increased TMB. CONCLUSIONS These results show that a CGP assay targeting {\~{}}1.1 Mb of coding genome can accurately assess TMB compared with sequencing the whole exome. Using this method, we find that many disease types have a substantial portion of patients with high TMB who might benefit from immunotherapy. Finally, we identify novel, recurrent promoter mutations in PMS2, which may be another example of regulatory mutations contributing to tumorigenesis.},

One area stems from a detailed knowledge of mutations that activate or inactivate signaling pathways that drive cancer development. This work triggered the development of targeted therapies that lead to clinical responses in the majority of patients bearing the targeted mutation, although responses are often of limited duration. In the second front are the advances in molecular immunology that unveiled the complexity of the mechanisms regulating cellular immune responses. These developments led to the successful targeting of immune checkpoints to unleash anti-tumor T cell responses, resulting in durable long-lasting responses but only in a fraction of patients.

However, early results of single-agent checkpoint inhibitors in multiple myeloma (MM) have been underwhelming. Therefore, we sought to understand the relationship between mutation and neoantigen landscape of MM patients and responsiveness to therapies. Somatic mutation burden, neoantigen load, and response to therapy were determined using interim data from the MMRF CoMMpass study (NCT01454297) on 664 MM patients. In this population, the mean somatic and missense mutation loads were 405.84(s = 608.55) and 63.90(s = 95.88) mutations per patient, respectively. There was a positive linear relationship between mutation and neoantigen burdens (R 2 = 0.862). The average predicted neoantigen load was 23.52 (s = 52.14) neoantigens with an average of 9.40(s = 26.97) expressed neoantigens. Survival analysis revealed significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with greater than average somatic missense mutation load (N = 163, 0.493 vs 0.726 2-year PFS, P = 0.0023) and predicted expressed neoantigen load (N = 214, 0.555 vs 0.729 2-year PFS, P = 0.0028). This pattern is maintained when stratified by disease stage and cytogenetic abnormalities. Therefore, high mutation and neoantigen load are clinically relevant risk factors that negatively impact survival of MM patients under current standards of care.},

abstract = {Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) lack recurrent targetable driver mutations but demonstrate frequent copy number aberrations (CNAs). Here, we describe an integrative genomic and RNAi-based approach that identifies and validates gene addictions in TNBCs. CNAs and gene expression alterations are integrated and genes scored for pre-specified target features revealing 130 candidate genes. We test functional dependence on each of these genes using RNAi in breast cancer and non-malignant cells, validating malignant cell selective dependence upon 37 of 130 genes. Further analysis reveals a cluster of 13 TNBC addiction genes frequently co-upregulated that includes genes regulating cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage response, and malignant cell selective mitotic genes. We validate the mechanism of addiction to a potential drug target: the mitotic kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1/HSET), essential for successful bipolar division of centrosome-amplified malignant cells and develop a potential selection biomarker to identify patients with tumors exhibiting centrosome amplification.},

@article{Chin2018,
abstract = {Pathology archives with linked clinical data are an invaluable resource for translational research, with the limitation that most cancer samples are formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Therefore, FFPE tissues are an important resource for genomic profiling studies but are under-utilised due to the low amount and quality of extracted nucleic acids. We profiled the copy number landscape of 356 breast cancer patients using DNA extracted FFPE tissues by shallow whole genome sequencing. We generated a total of 491 sequencing libraries from 2 kits and obtained data from 98.4{\%} of libraries with 86.4{\%} being of good quality. We generated libraries from as low as 3.8 ng of input DNA and found that the success was independent of input DNA amount and quality, processing site and age of the fixed tissues. Since copy number alterations (CNA) play a major role in breast cancer, it is imperative that we are able to use FFPE archives and we have shown in this study that sWGS is a robust method to do such profiling.},
