# CCG
This is an old repository that I used purely for storage for experimental jupyter notebooks while working as an intern at (now defunct) Cambridge Cancer Genomics. I keep it purely in case I ever want to go back and look for a neat solution to a problem that I may have found back before I had the patience to organise and document them properly! Don't expect to find much interesting.
