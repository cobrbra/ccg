This is an old repository that I used purely as storage for experimental jupyter notebooks I made while working as an intern at (now defunct, so no NDA issues) Cambridge Cancer Genomics. I keep it purely in case I ever want to go back and look for a neat solution to a problem that I may have discovered back before I had the patience to organise and document them properly! Don't expect to find much interesting.
